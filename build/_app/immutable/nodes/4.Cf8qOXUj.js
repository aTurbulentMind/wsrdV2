		trained in body and mind to play roller derby. Beginning in January 2012, our league hit the
		ground running as NDC, with skaters who had the passion and experience to make this league
		successful from day one. Our league has many facets we focus on intently, but the primary ones
		are equality, sportsmanship and democracy. We believe that no matter how long you have skated,
		that every skater has a voice in their league and that every skater has equal ownership in this
		league.</p> <p class="glass_Back">WSRD is a league that loves to have fun on and off the track. However, our league is our
		business, and we take running it very seriously. We are passionate about our training and the
		development of smart play. We are dedicated to playing derby at a competitive level. The success
		of this league is all due to our members' integrity, attention to detail and drive. We love
		organization, we love hard work and we are dedicated to always learning and bettering ourselves.
		We are committed to nurturing our new recruits and invest our time and positive attitudes into
		the training of our skaters. We strive to create and maintain an intentionally positive culture
		within our membership. We pride ourselves on behaving respectfully towards one another and to
		others outside of our league.</p> <p class="glass_Back">As of January 2015, our league is a registered non-profit corporation with the State of
		Washington and a 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization with the Internal Revenue Service. For more
		information about our tax exempt and non-profit status, including ways to donate, please contact
		us to discuss your opportunities to support us here.</p></main>`,1);function w(i){var t=m();g(v=>{c.title="About the team"});var a=d(t);o(a),r(a);var n=e(e(a,!0)),s=o(n),u=e(e(s,!0)),l=e(e(u,!0));e(e(l,!0)),r(n),h(i,t)}export{w as component};
