		OFFICIALS Skating Officials Do you know the basics of skating and want to become part of WSRD,
		but don't want want to be a team skater? Consider becoming a referee! WSRD is always looking for
		people who are interested in becoming a referee. As a referee you attend practices to learn the
		WFTDA rules and hand signals. Referees must follow all the same safety requirements as skaters
		(except mouth guards!). NSO NSOs (Non-Skating Officials) are essential to roller derby bouts!
		Our experienced NSOs are willing to teach you what you need to know. NSO jobs include penalty
		box timing, scorekeeping, line up tracking, penalty tracking, and more. Being an NSO is a great
		way to learn more about the nuts and bolts of derby rules. Contact our Volunteer Coordinator for
		information on how to start!
